Remixing Reality Demo
        for
Mozilla Web Oâ€™ Wonder
---------------------


See remixingreality/index.html

To run the demos locally on Firefox from a file:/// uri:
Go to about:config and set security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy to false.

(The problem is that by default a web page can't read from a local file, 
and that includes reading image data from a video.)

Or run a local webserver and view the demo there.


For the AR library, see https://github.com/kig/JSARToolKit
